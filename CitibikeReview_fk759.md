The null and alternative hypotheses have been satisfactorily formed & stated.

The featured data has been extracted and processed properly, with the independent variable of date and dependent variable of 
24-hour passed purchased (on weekdays vs. weekends) displayed.

I believe that the statistical analysis method most approppriate for testing the null hypothesis is the t-test.

The test compares whether the two different groups of interest, weekday vs. weekend riders, 
have different average values (number of 24-hours passes purchased). 

This should be an ideal test in determining whether or not the null is rejectable.
