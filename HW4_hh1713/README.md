# Assignment 1
Reviewd Dana Karwas (dlk253) citibikeproject. Had some trouble creating the pull request. Turns out I had to be in my github repo (inside the fork) but not in the classmates repo. Pushed a file called ipynb_checkpoints along with my review by accident.

# Assignment 3
Worked with Nicola Macchitella on this assignment.

Not able to import "from evalChisq import evalChisq" as in the notebook outline so we had to go another way to calculate the chi-square to use to look up in the chi-square table.
  
# Assignment 4
Worked with Nicola Macchitella on this assignment.

For some reason the PersonÂ´s test for correlation gave us a nan value for coefficient. The reason for this we were not able to work out.
Never got through changing the format of the date for the extra credit with the pd.to_datetime() function. Not sure if our dataset was unreasonably big and it was therefore taking a very very very long time or if the kernell repeatedly froze.
