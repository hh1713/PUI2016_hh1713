### Plot review
It is kind of difficult to review the plot as it's showing randomly generated numbers instead of real data. 

Axis: Would need to be renamed if you were depicting real data. Also is there a reason the x-axis and y-axis are written in the same colors used to plot the scatter? Do the dots apply to the x-axis and the blue dots to the y-axis?

Colors: The bright red and blue colors are easily visible. However I have a hard time seeing the difference of the darker two colors used.

Size: The plot could be a little bigger, would make the clustering clearer.

Best,
Keli!
