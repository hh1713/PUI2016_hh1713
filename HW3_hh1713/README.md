# Homework 1
Had discussions with Avikal Somvanshi to better understand the KS test and the AD test. Looked into doing the extra credit but understanding (or trying to understand them) took longer time than anticipated. Would have been interesting, but quite possibly complicated, to run bike station coordinates against coordinates of zipcodes in New York and split the data geographically down to boroughs that way.

# Homework 2
Worked with Nicola Macchitella on this assignment.
Figuring out what the data was telling us and finding a way to fit the OLS regressed line to the plotted data probably took the longest time.

# Homework 3
Worked with Nicola Macchitella on this assignment.

## Assignment 1
Decided on all distributions so that the mean was 100 and also tried to have the same or similar std.
Changed the values of 'Mysize' from int to float as many of the keys of the dictionary which holds the results
of the distributions got overwritten as many of the ints had identical values. I realize it is probably not ideal
to have key names of a dictionary with 6 or 8 decimal points but I couldn't figure out how to not overwrite keys.
Helped Christopher Streich and Adrian K. Dahlin with the understanding of different distributions.

## Assignment 2
Worked with Christopher Streich and Nicola Macchitella on this assignment.
Chris helped me understand how Federica's code to download and unzip files worked.
We decided to look into number of rides based on what day of the week the ride takes place on.
We had the idea that more people used citibike on weekdays (as more people commute to work) but it seems to be the other way around.

## Assignment 3
Worked with CWorked with Christopher Streich and Nicola Macchitella on this assignment.
If I understand z-values correctly the result tells me that the new mean is 2.5 standard deviations from the old mean and
our null hypothesis must therefore be rejected based of the confidence level decided upon in the beginning.
