Worked with Nicola Macchitella

# Assignment 1
Figuring out how to change the coordinate system into lat/lon ended up taking most amount of time.

# Assignment 2
With time 'til deadline running out and stress setting in the method of downloading the data and getting it to the correct format is way to manual. When time is running out and python skills are of short supplies one gets nervous that the pythonic way will take too long/not be succesful. Brute force is more predicatble. This is of course a non sensical way to go about it.
