# Assignment 1
Worked with Nicola Macchitella.

For some reason I do not understand my 2nd degree polynomial regression yields strange results (unchanged R square from the first degree polynomial for instance).

Took me a very long time to figure out why I couldn't fit lines to my scatter plots but then I found out it was because I hadn't cleaned the data enough, that is taking out the outliers. When the value of units or energy was zero as log(0) = -infinity.

Kristi Korsberg showed me another way of fitting the 2nd degree polynomial and plotting it.

# Assignment 2
Worked with Nicola Macchitella.

Crunched the data so it could be used to answer our null hypothesis. Needed to be able to calculate the standard deviation on different days of the week to compare mean of number of rides on weekdays and weekends.
